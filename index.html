    <section id="home">
      <p>As a recently separated United States Air Force Veteran, I completed a commendable 6-year service commitment after enlisting at 18. I served as a <em>Sensor Operator</em>: a career enlisted aviator & imagery analyst specializing in remotely piloted aircraft. I also explored various roles such as technical training instructor, database developer, adminsitrative specialist, resource advisor, and event coordinator - reaching the rank of <em>Staff Sergeant</em> in which I exercised my leadership capabilities. Upon separation from the military, I packed my bags, sold my car, and flew straight to the Big Apple - excited for any and all opportunity New York City has to offer. Shortly after, I enrolled in a Software Engineering program at Noble Desktop to forge the skills necessary to bring my visions to life. Simultaneously, I dedicate the rest of my time towards artisitically creative pursuits. Together, my leadership & management abilities, technical expertise, and creative innovation fuel my desire to create a multitude of products, services, and experiences for society.</p>
